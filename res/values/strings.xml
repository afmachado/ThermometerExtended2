        <item name="help_text_main">Main window displays chosen in settings ambient condition indicators. If application is receiving data from particular senors, it is immediately displayed, otherwise you see \'No Data\'. Data accuracy depends on hardware quality. Application merely display received data. Another possibility is that your device simply do not support chosen sensor. If so, you get \'Sensor unavailable\' message.</item>
        <item name="help_text_save_and_display_data">In order to see data history graph you must turn saving data mode on for particular sensor in its plot window. However be aware that it cause chosen sensors to stay active, even if you close application. That may drain device battery especially quickly. So always remember to stop saving data if you do not need it. By default this option is turned off. If particular sensor is working in data saving mode its icon is blue. Otherwise its greyed.</item>
        <item name="help_text_relative_humidity">Relative humidity is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in an air-water mixture to the saturated vapor pressure of water at a prescribed temperature. The relative humidity of air depends on temperature and the pressure of the system of interest. Humans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling (perspiration) as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Humans can be comfortable within a wide range of humidities depending on the temperature — from thirty to seventy percent - but ideally between fifty and sixty percent.</item>
        <item name="help_text_absolute_humidity">Absolute humidity is the mass of water vapor per unit volume of total air and water vapor mixture. Absolute humidity in the atmosphere ranges from near zero to roughly 30 grams per cubic meter when the air is saturated at 30 °C. The absolute humidity changes as air temperature or pressure changes. It does not take temperature into consideration.</item>
        <item name="help_text_dew_point">The dew point is the temperature below which the water vapor in air at constant barometric pressure condenses into liquid water at the same rate at which it evaporates. The condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface. The dew point is a water-to-air saturation temperature. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. Relative humidity of 100% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water.</item>
        <item name="help_text_light">Illuminance is a measure of how much luminous flux is spread over a given area. One can think of luminous flux (measured in lumens) as a measure of the total "amount" of visible light present, and the illuminance as a measure of the intensity of illumination on a surface. One lux is equal to one lumen per square metre. Achieving an illuminance of 500 lux might be possible in a home kitchen with a single fluorescent light fixture with an output of 12000 lumens.</item>
